## {{ meta.siteDescription }}

I'm Noah Song. This site is still a WIP.

I'm working on Archal Labs with Aidan Tiruvan. We got accepted into the YC S2026 batch. 

I'm 20 years old and studied math and physics at CU Boulder in Colorado. I like philosophy of religion, lifting, and reading!

I would love to talk about anything you have a deep interest in, reach out through any means
