## {{ meta.siteDescription }}

I'm Noah Song. This site is still a WIP.

I'm working on projects in computational chemistry and mega fast [hardware](https://www.greatsky.ai/).

Less officially I'm learning parallel programming from doing some [GPU puzzles](https://puzzles.modular.com/introduction.html) from Modular and the freely provided [parallel programming homeworks](https://ppc-exercises.cs.aalto.fi/courses) from the University of Helsinki. 

Sometimes I do other things, like lifting or reading books or ragebaiting (D1) or playing cello or doing homework. Having conversations with cool people would make this list, but sadly, I don't do it frequently enough. 

Connect w me on anything! I'm on x, li, and discord (theophorus_)
