## {{ meta.siteDescription }}

I'm Noah Song. This site is still a WIP.

I'm working on [Archal Labs](https://archal.ai) with Aidan Tiruvan. We got accepted into the YC S2026 batch. 

Sometimes I do other things, like lifting or [reading](https://noahsong-sdg.github.io/me/page-one/) or ragebaiting (D1) or playing cello or having conversations with cool people. 

I'm also still very much interested in things like geometric deep learning, infinity categories, and theoretical chemistry. 

Connect w me on anything! Please say hi.
