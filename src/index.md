## {{ meta.siteDescription }}

# Hi

I'm Noah Song. This site is still a WIP.

I'm working on projects in computational chemistry and mega fast [hardware](https://www.greatsky.ai/).

Less officially I'm learning parallel programming from doing some [GPU puzzles](https://puzzles.modular.com/introduction.html) from Modular and the freely provided [parallel programming homeworks](https://ppc-exercises.cs.aalto.fi/courses) from the University of Helsinki. 

I'm also a student at CU Boulder.

Sometimes I do other things, like ragebaiting anons online or lifting or reading books or playing cello. Having conversations with cool people would make this list, but its sadly infrequent. 

Connect w me on anything! I'm on x, li, and discord (theophorus_)
