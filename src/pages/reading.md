Books I liked and recommend:
- The Brothers Karamazov
- Perelandra, CS Lewis
- Skunk Works, Ben Rich
- Dealers of Lightning (on Xerox PARC, so legendary)
- Diamond Age, Neal Stephenson
- The Expanse 

Liked but don't necessarily recommend:
- Atlas Shrugged
- Dune 2-4
- Neuromancer
- The Haunting of Hill House
- The Secret History
- The Hard Thing about Hard Things
- Soul in a New Machine 

And others I didn't really enjoy. Next year I want to read more non-fiction
